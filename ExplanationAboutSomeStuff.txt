So, the source files for the docker are different than the other ones, because the docker is in Linux and I worked on Windows, so beware.
Know that to run tests on the docker, you should first launch ADB as nodaemon.
It should be like so: adb -a nodaemon server start
Because that way the docker can connect to the device properly.
In addition, when running the tests, it's best to start with telegram closed, or atleast only be in the main screen.
Docker image attached so that you don't have to build it yourself.
In the github repo you will also see some more explanations, primarily sources.
